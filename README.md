# Letter Frequency in Common Words

Analysis script to find the number of times each letter of the alphabet appears in 9,000 of the most common words in english.

In the book the Fountainhead, there is mention of "a youth who had written a thousand-page novel without a single letter o".

So I wanted to find out how many words there are available to use without the letter 'o', and also the how this number compared
with other letters.
