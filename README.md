# Letter Frequency in Common Words

Analysis script to find the number of times each letter of the alphabet appears in 9,000 of the most common words in english.

In the book The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, there is a line that describes "a youth who had written a thousand-page novel without a single letter o". This seemed far fetched, so I wanted to find out how many words there are available to use without the letter 'o', and also see how this number compares
with other letters.
